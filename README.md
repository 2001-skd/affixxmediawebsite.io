# Affixx Media

**Affixx Media** is a digital marketing agency website that I created for my friend's company. Although the project did not eventually take off, it was a great opportunity to experiment with and learn key frontend technologies.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React JS** – component-based UI development
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling for responsive design
- **Framer Motion** – smooth animations and scroll effects
- **React Router** – client-side routing for SPA experience

## 💡 What I Learned

- Creating and organizing **reusable components** across the application
- Setting up **React Router** for page navigation
- Implementing **scroll-based animations** with Framer Motion
- Designing a visually appealing and **fully responsive layout** using Tailwind CSS
- Gaining confidence in building static but production-ready React projects

## 📌 Notes

This project is a static showcase website but served as a valuable milestone in my React learning journey. It gave me the confidence to take on more complex frontend projects with modern tools and best practices.
